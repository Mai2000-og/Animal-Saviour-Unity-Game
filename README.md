# Animal Saviour Unity Game
A 2.5D platformer game made in Unity. I made this for my university project.

## 1. Storyline and Objective
The game is about an animal guardian saving his animal friends from poachers. 
As an animal spirit, you have to defeat the poachers alongside saving the captured animals which will give the player powers based on the species.

## 2. Content
The total levels, as of now are **two.**
Enemies in the game are just punching poachers and shooting poachers.
Animal species available is parrot, lion and rhinocerous. 
Challenges are platforming and traversing the enviroment while getting chased by poachers.

## 3. Thoughts
It is a typical amateur game made by a university student. 
Probably will not expand on this genre since I like third person/fps games more.
